\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{q1_8c}{q1.\+c}} \\*Write a C programming which is to simulate the functions of the OS to implement the Banker\textquotesingle{}s algorithm, to detect if the system is in Safestate or unsafe state. If it is in the safe state, your Banker’s algorithm need print out (display) the execution sequences in which these processes may complete on the screen. If it is in the unsafe state, your Banker’s algorithm need display which process it fails at by showing the available resources at this point of time, and the processes needed resources at this point of time }{\pageref{q1_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{q1_8h}{q1.\+h}} \\*This is a header file to \mbox{\hyperlink{q1_8c}{q1.\+c}}, }{\pageref{q1_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{q1test_cases_8c}{q1test\+Cases.\+c}} \\*This is a preset test case values file to \mbox{\hyperlink{q1_8c}{q1.\+c}}. This is meant for the user to use these preset test cases if the user do not wish to key in individual inputs manually }{\pageref{q1test_cases_8c}}{}
