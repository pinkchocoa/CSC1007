\brief
Write a C programming which is to simulate the functions of OS to
implement these three dynamic memory allocation approaches: First-fit, 
Best-fit and Worst-fit and compare the results.

If it is in the safe state, your Bankerâ€™s algorithm need print out
(display) the execution sequences in which these processes may 
complete on the screen. 

Given 12 memory partitions available (holes): 160 KB, 350 KB, 650 KB, 
80 KB, 410 KB, 50 KB, 720 KB, 905 KB, 570 KB, 130 KB, 260 KB, and 
830 KB (in order), how would each of the first-fit, best-fit, and 
worst-fit algorithms allocate 10 input processes with different sizes 
(in order)?
